									<h3>Suspendisse quis massa vel justo</h3>
									<p>During two months, from June 12 to August 12, I did my internship with the company Africa Health Services and Formations located in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Taking place in the commercial sector of the company, I have actively participated in the creation and development of an economic activity newcomer to a company.</p>
									<p>This internship allowed me to open up to many aspects of the business such as customer prospecting, setting up in place for negotiation, maintaining a relationship with clients, following up with the client after the implementation partnership, attention to competition and taking market share from competitors.</p>
									<p>Beyond all that, this internship has given me the knowledge I need for any business. These are assets that I will use throughout my career, perhaps in a slightly different way, but the bases I have I am convinced that the skills that I will be able to learn at ASSF will be extremely important for my future life and career in the world of finance.</p>
									<p>During this internship my main tasks were to make appointments with the directors of medical analysis laboratories, to manage negotiations in order to set up a partnership as well as customer follow-up. This is done through appointments, visits to clinics but also appointments with the doctors I have learned. From the first month of the internship, I was completely operational especially at the level of negotiation with the client. It is at this level that my skills in communication have evolved and have really allowed me to present a service and all that it encompasses, the negotiation was one of the essential pillars of my internship.</p>
